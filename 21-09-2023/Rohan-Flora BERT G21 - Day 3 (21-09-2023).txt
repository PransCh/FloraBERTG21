Today, We focused on exploring several dataset websites relevant to my goal of training a BERT model for predicting genomic expressions/endophenotypes from basic DNA/RNA sequences.

This is what I've found about the websites: 

Miaze GDB: I started by investigating the Miaze GDB (Genome Database for Maize) for potential datasets. This resource likely contains genomic data related to maize, which could be valuable for model training. I checked if they have the necessary data for my project.

Ensemble FTP: The Ensemble FTP server is a rich source of genomic data from various organisms. I searched for datasets specific to the genomic expressions and endophenotypes 

RefSeq: RefSeq is a comprehensive database of genomic sequences and annotations. I explored it to identify relevant datasets that could aid in training my BERT model. I should verify if they provide the necessary information and download any pertinent datasets.

Overall, today our exploration of these dataset websites was essential for gathering potential data sources for my BERT model.
